# Hangman-game-using-python
A guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. For each letter that is not in the word, the first player draws a part of a hangman's gallows. The game continues until the word is guessed or the gallows is complete and the player who is guessing the word is "hanged."
